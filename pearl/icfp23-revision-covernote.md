Thanks for allowing me to revise the paper. I made the following changes:

* The paper is deanonymized, and this time I did not forget the `review` option.
* As per the reviewer B and the condensing of Section 5, I removed the third contributions. Since a two-bullet contribution list is not pretty, I rephrased to a single contribtion.
* Section 5 is replaced by a much shorter section “Caveats”
* The Datafun comparision is expanded by stressing that that’s a _total_ language, and that helps with coming up with a denotation. This connects to the caveat section about the lack of a denotional semantics.
* A few words are writtena about Hatafun, but the authors says he sees this mostly as an experiment embedding datafun's type system into Haskell. We were not able to reasonably implement our examples using that experiment.
* The full code corresponding to the fragment in Section 3.3 is put into a new appendix.
* Addressed most minor comments and fixed a bunch of typos
* Section 4.2 is more explicit the set of equations it solves.
