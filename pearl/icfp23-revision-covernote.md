Thanks for allowing me to revise the paper. I made the following changes:

* The paper is deanonymized, and this time I did not forget the `review` option.
* As per the reviewer B and the condensing of Section 5, I removed the third contributions. Since a two-bullet contribution list is not pretty, I rephrased to a contribtion.
* Addressed most minor comments and fixed a bunch of typos
* Section 4.2 is more explicit the set of equations it solves.
