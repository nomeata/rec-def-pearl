Thanks for allowing me to revise the paper. I made the following changes:

* The paper is deanonymized, and this time I did not forget the `review` option.
* As per the reviewer B and the condensing of Section 5, I removed the third contributions. Since a two-bullet contribution list is not pretty, I rephrased to a single contribtion.
* Section 5 is replaced by a much shorter section “Caveats”
* The Datafun comparision is expanded by stressing that that’s a _total_ language, and that helps with coming up with a denotation. This connects to the caveat section about the lack of a denotional semantics.
* The Hatafun comparision is expanded with example code, a bit in the related work section, and a larger one in an appendix, provided by the author. He says that he saw Hatafun mostly as an experiment embedding datafun's type system into Haskell, though.
* Similarly, the comparision to datafix (which is at least as relevant) is expanded.
* The full code corresponding to the fragment in Section 3.3 is put into a new appendix.
* Addressed most minor comments and fixed a bunch of typos
* Section 4.2 is more explicit the set of equations it solves.
